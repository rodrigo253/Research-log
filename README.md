# WEEK 3




Well to start off, the making of the survey was something interesting.
There's a lot of reasons for this; like for one we were suppose to make it reply trying to make it simple as possible, for the audience so they can answer the questions straight-forward and not have a second thought about it.
The whole experience was really cool not just cause of the project, but it was my 1st week and I met new people who were really interesting plus helpful whenever you had a question.
I really do think this work affects the sence of our audience in a good way because my group and I kept analyzing each question and trying to make it as simple as possible. For piercehacker, looking back at it was also indeed interesting. Personally i believe pierce hacker is for the Pierce community, espicially for us in technical writing, to help us advance our knowledge of this concept. This week i really did learn a lot. I learned how to use codes on github, how to type out instructions, and I also learned how to make a nice written survey people. I also learned how to be more open minded to things, so overall this week did go well; even when i was struggling in the beginning.
# WEEk 4
This week was really different from any other english class. 
We were doing an analytic report on technology do students and professors from pierce college need help with the most.
For example, Microsoft, Google, iOS, etc. 
If you don't know, an analytical report is the type of business reporting that is used to make decisions. Analytical reports offer both information and analysis, but they also include recommendations. Offering recommendations is the biggest difference between informational and analytical reporting.
I really learned a lot this week. 
Not just the analytical report, but also critical thinking.
My group and I were trying to find the best way to ask questions for survey; what we were trying to make it was short and simple so the reader wouldn't have to take so much time on it and actually do it.
Because usually when people get sent survey's and it isn't mandetory, they usually wouldn't care a ton about it.
