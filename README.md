# WEEK 3




Well to start off, the making of the survey was something interesting.
There's a lot of reasons for this; like for one we were suppose to make it reply trying to make it simple as possible, for the audience so they can answer the questions straight-forward and not have a second thought about it.
The whole experience was really cool not just cause of the project, but it was my 1st week and I met new people who were really interesting plus helpful whenever you had a question.
