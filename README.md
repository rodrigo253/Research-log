# WEEK 3




Well to start off, the making of the survey was something interesting.
There's a lot of reasons for this; like for one we were suppose to make it reply trying to make it simple as possible, for the audience so they can answer the questions straight-forward and not have a second thought about it.
The whole experience was really cool not just cause of the project, but it was my 1st week and I met new people who were really interesting plus helpful whenever you had a question.
I really do think this work affects the sence of our audience in a good way because my group and I kept analyzing each question and trying to make it as simple as possible. For piercehacker, looking back at it was also indeed interesting. Personally i believe pierce hacker is for the Pierce community, espicially for us in technical writing, to help us advance our knowledge of this concept. This week i really did learn a lot. I learned how to use codes on github, how to type out instructions, and I also learned how to make a nice written survey people. I also learned how to be more open minded to things, so overall this week did go well; even when i was struggling in the beginning.
# WEEK 4
This week was really different from any other english class. 
We were doing an analytic report on technology do students and professors from pierce college need help with the most.
For example, Microsoft, Google, iOS, etc. 
If you don't know, an analytical report is the type of business reporting that is used to make decisions. Analytical reports offer both information and analysis, but they also include recommendations. Offering recommendations is the biggest difference between informational and analytical reporting.
I found this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSVEsZjGf30) really helpful on explaining analytical reports.
I really learned a lot this week. 
Not just the analytical report, but also critical thinking.
My group and I were trying to find the best way to ask questions for survey; what we were trying to make it was short and simple so the reader wouldn't have to take so much time on it and actually do it.
Because usually when people get sent survey's and it isn't mandetory, they usually wouldn't care a ton about it.
# WEEK 5
When drafting the report with my partner Richard, at first we did not know where to start. We were not trying to mess up, so we sat there just questioning ourselves. So at the end I told him to not think about it too much and just start writing; and so we did. The reason to this was because we were wasting a lot of time just looking at a screen. The feedback on thursday was really good for us because we got to see if we were doing it correct as other people in class and we were. It really helped us so we because now we could've seen what path we should be taking on this assignment. Between now and monday our goal is to finish the assignment. This week overall taught me that when working with others you really got to be a helping hand or else it isnt going to be an easy task for everyone. So next week I'm going to put more effort on that. 
# WEEK 8
The OER project that you need help creating with some of the class have me curious. The reason to this is because, I think it would help a lot of people who are entering into technical writing if there was a open educational resource for this technical writing class. Furthermore, as a project it has me interested because I don't like working by myself, I'd rather work with a group. Like when needed to do independent work I'll do it, but I prefer to work as a group just because you can communicate your ideas and recieve feedback immediately. If I were to take this option, things I would do too prepare for this would probably be going to google and searching up how an OER looks and see whate kind of route I'll take for this assignment.
